# Lifeline-Blood-Bank-Management-system-
Lifeline (Blood Bank Management system) is our final year project 

Lifeline (BBMS) was built using ASP.net and MySQL.

This Management System was built for people and blood banks to avail blood when in need.

We built digital inventory for blood which reflects the avaiability of blood bags in our  inventory.
